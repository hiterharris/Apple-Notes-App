Slightly older is the David Tennant Hamlet, available on DVD and Blu-Ray (Amazon.com, Amazon UK), with another psychological approach to the role.  --break--  But this year's Hamlet takes a different tack. the 25 year-old actor Papa Essiedu portrays a Hamlet that is petulant and impulsive, one who wears his madness as a badge of pride.  But is his madness real or just feigned"
