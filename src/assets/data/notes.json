        "text": "It hasn't been long since the last RSC production of Hamlet. In 2013, the RSC featured Jonathan Slinger as Hamlet, in an introspective performance. Slightly older is the David Tennant Hamlet, available on DVD and Blu-Ray (Amazon.com, Amazon UK), with another psychological approach to the role.  --break--  But this year's Hamlet takes a different tack. the 25 year-old actor Papa Essiedu portrays a Hamlet that is petulant and impulsive, one who wears his madness as a badge of pride.  But is his madness real or just feigned"
